If you want to contact me please write at longo.1655653@studenti.uniroma1.it.

If you want to play with the tool:
- You can [try it](https://1655653.github.io/FACT_data_analysis/) 
- You could download the repo, change the ADDRESS variable and connect it with your machine where FACT runs. 

NOTE: FACT-Vis has been developed mainly on chrome, so different behaviour are possible with other browser.
Enjoy!
